# minecraft-server-ping-tracker
Batch file I wrote designed to keep track of a given server, using https://github.com/xPaw/PHP-Minecraft-Query and Curl

This only works on Windows 10

Note: Works for servers that are 1.6 and up, and are pingable.

Credit to https://github.com/xPaw/PHP-Minecraft-Query for the actual PHP script used to interact with the ping API, and to https://www.php.net/ for the PHP executable used to run the PHP scripts.

Also credit to Dropbox for storing some of the optional files.
